## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Aishwarya, a Ph.D. Candidate and Computer Science Researcher at Iowa State University. My current research explores algorithmic and systems-level optimizations for neural networks, aiming to reduce computational and communication overhead while maintaining model accuracy. I am particularly interested in efficient data movement, parallel computing, memory management, and distributed optimization tailored for modern HPC platforms.  

### 🔭 I'm currently
-  **working** on accelerating neural networks on HPC systems.
-  **learning** about Mixture of Experts (MoE) and In-context Learning.  

### 🚀 Research Interests  
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) 
- High-Performance Computing (HPC) & Distributed Systems  
- Deep Learning Optimizations & MoE Models  
- Parallel Computing & Cloud AI

### 🏕️ Hobbies
- Reading books from various genres and trying to explore as many topics as I can. Check out some of my favorite books on my [website](https://aishwaryyasarkar.github.io/).
- Playing various racquet sports.
- Watching documentaries, especially on history and science.
