## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Aishwarya, a Ph.D. Candidate and Computer Science Researcher at Iowa State University. My current research explores algorithmic and systems-level optimizations for neural networks, aiming to reduce computational and communication overhead while maintaining model accuracy. I am particularly interested in efficient data movement, parallel computing, memory management, and distributed optimization tailored for modern HPC platforms.  

### 🔭 I'm currently
-  **working** on accelerating neural networks on HPC systems.
-  **learning** about Mixture of Experts (MoE), LLM Agents, and In-Context Learning.  

### 🚀 Research Interests  
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) 
- High-Performance Computing (HPC) & Distributed Systems  
- Deep Learning Optimizations & MoE Models  
- Parallel Computing & Cloud AI

### 🏕️ Hobbies
- Reading books from various genres and trying to explore as many topics as I can. Check out some of my favorite books on my [website](https://aishwaryyasarkar.github.io/).
- Playing various racquet sports.
- Watching documentaries, especially on history and science.

#### ⚡ Fun Fact: AI wants to end my career 👽
> ❝ You're optimizing HPC like a pro, but somehow your debugging process still involves sacrificing print statements to the gods of segmentation faults. 
> 
> You dream of reducing communication overhead—maybe start by not arguing with your own scripts at 3 AM. 🚀 
> 
>  Your GNNs are distributed, just like your sanity when debugging. You claim to love parallelism, yet your tasks are just a thousand threads of chaos with no mutex in sight. 
> 
>  And let’s face it, your code crashes more often than your motivation. At this point, your PhD isn’t about HPC—it’s about High Pain Computing. 💀   
>
>  Is your HPC career dead yet 💀 or do you want me to vectorize the insults for even faster execution? 😈 ❞
